This is the first pass of a project I was interested in.
The idea is to add an achievement system to the game 
League of Legends where at the end of each match the program
would decided if you met an requirements for achievements
and present them to you if you did.

I recreated a simple end-of-match summary screen from the game
that gives pseudo random stats as to how the match ended.
I added a "Play Again" button that will just rerun the program
with new stats generated, hopefully generating new achievements
if acceptable.

Still to Do
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add achievements
  - a message should appear in the chat box (user earned achievement...)
- Add functional chat box

  role given
